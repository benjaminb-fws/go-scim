// Lock provides a set of methods to allow callers obtain exclusive modification rights
// to a resource. This protects the underlying resource from concurrent modification failures.
// The provider does not specify lock fairness, it is up to the implementations. The implementations
// are also encouraged to implement an auto-unlock mechanism which kicks in after a lock has been
// held on for long periods of time, so that to avoid the situation where the process with a lock
// crashed and failed to unlock.

	// If lock failed to obtain within the contextual time limits, an error will be returned.
